Scajong

A simple Mahjong solitaire game written in the programming language Scala.
The game does not use the typical Mahjong tiles, instead it uses the logos
of various Open Source related projects and organisations. Can you name them?

This game was written for a Scala course at the University of Applied
Sciences in Constance in the fall of 2012.

Building:

The easy way to build the game from source is sbt (http://www.scala-sbt.org/).
To build a standalone .jar with all dependencies you can use the assembly
command. Just install sbt from the sbt website, open a command line in this
folder and run "sbt assembly". This should load all needed libraries and start
the building and packaging. The result should be a scajong.jar file in the
project folder.

If you use Eclipse, you have to download the required jar files of all the
refrenced librarys and put them in the directory of the project. You can see
the required libraries by opening the included .classpath file in an editor!

Testing:

We supply tests for most of our classes except the views. They are located in
the test folder. You can run them either over Eclipse with JUnit or with sbt.
Open a command line in the project dir and run "sbt test" to execute all tests.

We also included scct (http://mtkopone.github.com/scct/) to measure the code
coverage of our tests. To run scct open a command line in the project dir and
run "sbt clean scct:test". The results will be saved as HTML files in the
project subdirectory "target\scala-x.x.x\coverage-report\".
